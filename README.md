# KRMU CONNECT - MINI PROJECT WEBAPP
KRMU Connect is a web-based platform designed to foster social interaction among students of K.R. Mangalam University using humor and memes as the core medium. The platform enables users to swipe on memes, find like-minded peers based on reactions, and build new friendships in a lighthearted and student-focused environment.

🧠 Inspiration
While other platforms like Tinder or Bumble focus on dating, and apps like Reddit and Discord enable community discussions, KRMU Connect aims to combine meme culture and friendship discovery within a university ecosystem. We were inspired by meme-based platforms like Schmooze and student-centric networking concepts like Harvard Connect.
